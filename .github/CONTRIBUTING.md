There are a few ways how you can contribute to the development of this plugin:

### Report issues & suggest features
It's already a huge help to receive detailed bug reports and thought-through feature requests. You can submit any of these by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/distantnative/search-for-kirby/issues/new) and using the issue templates, which are set up to guide you through providing all information that will help working on these.
